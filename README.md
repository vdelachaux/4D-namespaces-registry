# 4D Namespaces Registry

This page provides a curated list of [namespaces](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Extensions/develop-components#declaring-the-component-namespace) used by published 4D components, created by both 4D and the developer community.

With the growing number of available 4D components and the [4D Project Dependencies](https://github.com/4d/4D-namespaces-registry/blob/main/README.md) feature, it’s easier than ever to work with updated components. However, the increase in components also means more namespaces, raising the risk of duplicate namespaces and potential conflicts.

> ⓘ **Note:**  
> A namespace ensures no conflict arises when a project uses different components that may have classes or functions with identical names.

## Why Use the Registry?

By registering your namespace here, you can:

- **Avoid Conflicts**: Prevent issues that occur when two components share the same namespace.
- **Stay Organized**: Ensure your component can be integrated smoothly with others in larger projects.
- **Promote Consistency**: Help the 4D developer community maintain a clear, organized system for components.

Before selecting a namespace for your component, we highly recommend consulting the list below to avoid duplicates. Once you’ve chosen a unique name, submit it for inclusion in this registry. For details on how to contribute, please refer to our [Contribution Guidelines](contributing.md).
